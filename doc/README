********************************************************************************

TISC is a program written in C under Linux (MacOS) to calculate the pseudo-3D 
(planform) flexure of the lithosphere, fluvial transport along rivers, and 
other surface and tectonic processes. In particular, TISC numerically 
simulates the formation of sedimentary basins during tectonic compression 
and extension. TISC is the 3D version of the cross-section (pseudo 2D) 
numerical model tAo, and uses the finite difference technique.

FILES:

tisc/README  instructions for compilation and software setup.
tisc/doc/tisc.info.txt Main documentation file explaining command-line syntax, inputs and outputs, references.
tisc/doc/template.PRM Template parameter file. Contains the default parameter values.
tisc/demo/ Several examples. Most relevant to the paper is tisc/demo/4_river_transport

TISC uses the open-sourced GMT4 software for the graphic PostScript output, available at https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org/

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

Either a Mac or a Ubuntu Linux virtual machine including GMT4 (for graphic 
output) are required:

    Install Virtualbox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

	Download virtual machine including Ubuntu 20.04 + GMT 4.5.18 from:
	https://saco.csic.es/index.php/s/ZTK4dXWS6JYtjr5
	Usuario: usuario
	Passwd: usuario20
	GMT 4.5.18 at /home/usuario/Software/gmt-4.5.18

    Import VM with Ubuntu 20.04 + GMT 4.5.18.
	Virtualbox > File > Import...


TO INSTALL TISC:

-Uncompress the downloaded file in a directory 'tisc/'.

-Modify compiling options by editing 'tisc/config.mk' and 'tisc/src/Makefile'.

-Compile typing 'make' in the main directory. This will create the executable 
tisc in the tisc/bin/ directory. Then include tisc/bin/ and tisc/script/ 
in your shell path.

-Install GMT 4 (free-ware software, used for graphic output) and put 
its bin/ directory in your path. This should work:
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install gmt ksh csh tofrodos

-The GMT scripts are wirtten in C-shell language, so make sure to have that one 
installed.

-Try examples of running TISC going to directory 'tisc/demo/'. This will allow
you to be sure that the code is working properly. Check that the graphic
output is correctly produced in the postscript output files (*.ps)

-Read the 'doc/tisc.info.txt' file to know more about how to use TISC.
