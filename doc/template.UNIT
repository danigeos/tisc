###  Sample *.UNIT file for TISC  ###
#UNIT files are used to define new Blocks in TISC and tAo (loads, faults, ...)
#First UNIT is read from file 'project1.UNIT', 2nd 'project2'.UNIT, etc.
#The unit parameters and thickness contained in these *.UNIT files 
#is read from the routine 'read_file_unit()' in tisc.c. 
#Have a look at that one to better understand how this input works.

#PARAMETER	VALUE	UNITS
#----------------------------
z_default	0	[m] Default z-value (unit thickness/fault depth) in the nodes
				where it is not  specified. z<0 downwards except if fault=1 (see
				below). 
mode_interp	4	Default interpolation mode for input files (will be  applied if
				this parameter is not specified in  the files themselves):
			#0: 3-column file containing x,y,z in 'Nx x Ny' skyline- sorted
				rows.  x,y are ignored. (no interpolation  performed).
			#1: 3-column file containing x,y,z. Inverse distance interpolation
				with the points supplied.
			#2: 3-column file containing x,y,z. Inv. square dist.  interpolation
				with the points supplied.
			#3: 3-column file containing x,y,z. The nearest given  point is
				assigned each cell.
			#4: polygon interpolation mode. See explanation in file 
				'tisc.info.txt', end of 'inputs' section.
			#5: binary (short int) skyline array of z values (no  interpolation
				performed).
			#6: 1-column file containing z-values in 'Nx x Ny'  skyline-sorted
				rows (no interpolation  performed).
			#7: same as 4 but also those nodes falling out of all  polygons are
				interpolated with the distance to  each polygon (no default
				value assigned).
			#8: 3-column file containing x,y,z. Each cell gets a  value if some
				point is given inside, otherwise  it gets the default value. If
				more than one  value is given then they will be averaged.
add_random	0	[z-units] Add random number to z between +- that value.
z_absol		0	[0/1]	For faults, 0 means z values are relative to initial
				zero (current deflection will be added to z values);  1 means
				they will be used as absolute values.


#Parameters of the new unit:
time		0	[Ma]	Time when this load/unit must be applied. Note  that
					'time' in each unit file must be  larger than in the
					previous unit file  (projectname'N-1'.UNIT).
vel_x		0	[km/Ma]	Velocity in x. Blocks move by an entire number of  nodes
					at each time step.
vel_y		0	[km/Ma]	Velocity in y. Blocks move by an entire number of  nodes
					at each time step.
time_stop	9999	[Ma]	Time to stop the Block/unit.
density		2800	[kg/m3]	Density of this load/unit.
erodibility	100e3	[m]	erodibility of the unit.

#Unit properties [0=NO, 1=YES]:
gradual 	0	[0/1]	To distribute loading until the next load time.
hidden		0	[0/1]	To hide the load (won't be plot and won't contribute to 
					topography, will just add the corresponding load). Not
					available for 'gradual' blocks.
move		0	[0/1]	To move the load with 'vel_x,vel_y' (km/Ma)  till
					'Time_stop' (Ma). 
fault		0	[0/1]	Means that x-y points refer to the base of a  fault
					moving at a constant velocity  vel_x,vel_y (km/Ma) until
					'Time_stop'.  'z_value' is here the depth of the  fault in
					absence of isostatic  movements (depth the fault would have 
					at the initial time).
ride		0	[0/1]	To let the previous overlaying units be dragged  by the
					present one. Both their velocity  and time_stop will be
					reset. 
cut_units	0	[0/1]	Existing units (except sediments) will be cut  by this
					new fault. By default it cuts  only undeformed basement.
#cut_unit	0		Only the indicated unit (in the internal  registry, as shown
					at the end of the  run, not the user-specified units)  will
					be cut by this new fault.  If negative, it will take the 
					absolute value as a density and cut  the largest unit with
					that density.  
cut_all		0	[0/1]	All units (also sediments) should be cut by  this new
					fault.
thin_sheet	0	[0/1]	Calculate the deformation of this unit with a  thin
					viscous sheet (Bird, 1991).  Assumes local isostasy.
insert		0	[0/1]	Do not put this load on the top of the Blocks,  but
					insert it as the lowest load.
top		0	[0/1]	Put this load on the top of the Blocks, but as  the highest
					load.
#densenv	0	[0/1]	to change the density of the environment (air or water).
topoest		0	[0/1]	1 means topographic load, i.e., the load is vertically
					fixed and does not subside  but the deflection is filled
					with a  Block of 'densinfill' density. This is  equivalent
					to switch_topoest=1 in the  parameters file.
#fill_up_to	0	[m]	If present, TISC fills with constant density  up to the
					given height [m].  Distribution will not be read.

#Now the detph/thickness z of the unit. When not a fault, z>0 means the 
#thickness of load emplaced; z<0 means the rock thickness excavated and removed.
#For mode_interp=4, pass the z_value (thickness/fault_depth) for next polygon:
50	[n|c]		[m]	z_value at polygon;  'n' means that the  value at points
					falling inside this  polygon labelled but outside the next 
					polygon are linearly interpolated with  the distance to both
					polygons; 'c'  means constant in this polygon;
#Polygon where to apply previous z_value [for mode_interp 4 & 7]
-100e3	-100e3		[m] [m]	X, Y
-100e3	+100e3		[m] [m]	X, Y
+100e3	+100e3		[m] [m]	X, Y
+100e3	-100e3		[m] [m]	X, Y

#For other mode_interp values, 3 columns (X,Y,Z) or 1 column (Z) are expected.
