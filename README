TISC is a program written in C under Linux to calculate the 2D (planform) 
flexure of the  lithosphere, fluvial transport along, and, in particular, to 
numerically simulate the formation of foreland basins. TISC is the 3D version 
of the cross-section (pseudo 2D) numerical model tAo, and uses the finite 
difference technique.

TO INSTALL a Ubuntu Linux virtual machine with GMT4 (required for graphic output):

    Install Virtualbox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

	Download https://geo3bcnbox.geo3bcn.csic.es/index.php/s/mlQPch1DQDsY0ih/download

    Import VM with Ubuntu 20.04 + GMT 4.5.18.
	Virtualbox > File > Import...


TO INSTALL TISC:

TISC has been developed in C under Linux, and is ready for compilation in a Mac 
Linux environment.

-Uncompress the downloaded file in a directory 'tisc/'.

-Modify compiling options by editing 'tisc/config.mk' and 'tisc/src/Makefile'.

-Compile typing 'make' in the main directory. This will create the executable 
tisc in the tisc/bin/ directory. Then include tisc/bin/ and tisc/script/ 
in your shell path.

-Install GMT 4 (free-ware software, used for graphic output) and put 
its bin/ directory in your path. This should work:
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install gmt ksh csh tofrodos

-The GMT scripts are wirtten in C-shell language, so make sure to have that one 
installed.

-Try examples of running TISC going to directory 'tisc/demo/'. This will allow
you to be sure that the code is working properly. Check that the graphic
output is correctly produced in the postscript output files (*.ps)

-Read the 'doc/tisc.info.txt' file to know more about how to use TISC.
