#TISC VERSION FOR THIS FILE:
version	TISC_2017-05-19

#MODELED REGION: 
#Coordinates of the center of corner cells (i.e., netCDF's "node registration").
#The left limit of the left-most cells is at xmin-dx/2. 
xmin		-250e+03	Western model limit coordinate [m]
xmax		+250e+03	Eastern model limit coordinate [m]
ymin		-250e+03	Southern model limit coordinate [m]
ymax		+250e+03	Northern model limit coordinate [m]

zmin		-3000	Vertical range (for graphic purposes only)
zmax		2000	Vertical range (for graphic purposes only)

#GRIDDING:
#dx is automalically defined as (xmax-xmin)/(Nx-1)
Nx		101	E-W direction grid points. 
Ny		101	N-S direction grid points

#INITIAL RELIEF:
zini		0	Initial altitude [m] above sea level (added to the initial
				topography in '*.ZINI').
random_topo	0	Adds noise to initial topo between -random_topo/2 and 
				+random_topo/2 [m]. The computation of lake drainage can become
				much slower using a high value.

#DENSITIES [kg/m3]:
densasthen	3250	Density beneath the lithospheric plate, at the isostatic
				compensation level in the asthenosphere
denscrust	2848	Mean density of crust (used for the basement).
densinfill	2849	Used only if topoest==1. Infill density used to fill
				under topographic (fixed) loads.
denssedim	2200	Sediment density at deposition (bulk, including pores and
				their water content).
densenv		0	Environment density (air or water) above the existing blocks.
sed_porosity 0.3		Mean porosity of sediment at deposition (seafloor). For
				density purposes, pores are assumed to be filled by water. The
				bulk density is fixed through 'denssedim', this porosity is used
				just to convert eroded/deposited volumes into bulk rock mass.
compact_depth 3000	Depth at which sediment porosity is reduced by a factor e,
				due to compaction [m]. 0 (zero) means no compaction.

#TIME VARIABLES [My] (time goes from negative to positive: Timeini<Timefinal):
Timeini		0	Initial time.
Timefinal	9	Final time.
dt 		0.5	Time step (>0, time increment or interval) for flexure and
				deformation.
dt_eros		0.001	Approximate dt for surface processes (will be adjusted to
				the closest entire fraction of dt). To avoid artifact
				knickpoints in rivers use about 0.0001 or less. 
dt_record	2	Time lag between records of sedimentary horizons (time lines)
				and deflection evolution (written in '*.xyzt'). If =0, will be
				recorded only at the times of *.UNIT files, and at those times
				specified in the '*.REC' file. (>0)

#FLEXURE:
isost_model	1	Isostasy mechanism: 
			#0: No isostasy.
			#1: Pure elastic thin plate.
			#2: Viscoelastic thin plate.
Te		15e3	Default EET [m] when no *.EET file is given. Te=0 => local
				isostasy. Usual values are between 0 and 150 km.
tau		1	Relaxation time in Myr (used only for the viscoelastic plate model:
				isost_model=2). tau=viscosity*(2*(1+nu))/E. 1 Myr implies a 
				lithospheric viscosity of 1e24 Pa s.
boundary_conds	5	Boundary conditions for flexure at N, S, E, W (4 
			characters):
			#0: means fixed boundary (zero deflection).
			#5: means free boundary (null 1st and second derivates, 
				i.e., null slope and moment).
			#6: fixes local isostatic deflection at boundary.
water_load	1	To take into account sea+lake load and allow for temporal sea
				level variations read from '*.SLV'.
topoest		0	If 1 then the final topography (instead of load thickness)
				will be read from *.UNIT files. That topography is vertically
				fixed, filling the deflection with densinfill material.
#Tectonic horizontal forces [Pa*m=N/m]:
Px		0	Horizontal tectonic force in x (compressive => >0)
Py		0	Horizontal tectonic force in y
Pxy		0	Horizontal tectonic shear force xy

#CLIMATE AND SURFACE WATER FLOW (params. used only if hydro_model=1):
hydro_model	0	Defines the hydrological (climate&drainage) model. 
			#0: no precipitation, no fluvial transport. The 
				following parameters have no effect.
			#1: runoff(x,y) = (rain + Krain*elevation[km]) * 
				(1-DX/CXrain) * (1-DY/CYrain) 
				is used if no *.RAIN file is given or if the 
				value in that file is negative. DX,DY is the 
				distance to the centre of the model.
			#2: orographic precipitation following Roer et al. 
				(2003, JGR).
			#3: orographic precipitation following Garcia-
				Castellanos (2007, EPSL), water-conservative.
rain		500	[l/m2/yr]=[mm/yr]=[1.58e-8 m3/m2/s].
			If hydro_model=1: 'rain' or precipitation (or runoff, 
				water going to the drainage system) if no 
				*.RAIN file is given or if the file value is 
				negative. 
			If hydro_model=2: Precipitation at T=0 C at plains or 
				in absence of wind.
			If hydro_model=3: Precipitation in a saturated column 
				(related to turbulence)
				P = rain * Water_col / Water_sat
Krain		0	If hydro_model=1: proportionality of runoff with 
				altitude [l/m2/yr/km]
			If hydro_model>=2: mean wind velocity [m/s] (Krain>0 
				and usually Krain<10).
windazimut	90	If hydro_model>=2: azimut of wind flow direction in 
				degrees counted clockwise from north (i.e., 
				from positive y axis).
relhumid	1	If hydro_model==3: humidity factor of incomming wind 
				(0 to 1).
CXrain		0	If hydro_model=1: proportionality of runoff with x (distance
				[m] from domain center to where rain becomes 0 and double).
				Negative means rain increases westwards. 0 means no variations
				along x;
			If hydro_model>=2: smoothing distance along upwind direction
				related to turbulence and finite time of condensation and
				precipitation (~1e4 m). Typically a few km. Leave it as 0 if
				cell size is not smaller than that. 
CYrain		0	If hydro_model=1: proportionality of runoff with y 
				(distance [m] from domain center to where rain becomes 0 and 
				double). Negative means rain increases southwards. 0 means no
				variations along y;
			If hydro_model==2: smoothing distance along y related to turbulence
				and finite time of condensation and precipitation (~1e4 m).
			If hydro_model==3: unused parameter.
evaporation	0	Evaporation rate at lakes [l/m2/yr]=[mm/yr]. evaporation>runoff
				can significantly slow down the hydrological calculations. 
			If hydro_model=1,2: laterally constant evaporation.
			If hydro_model=3: evaporation caused by dry air and 0 wind speed. E
				is then calculated as: E=evaporation * (1+beta*wind) *
				(Wmax-Wcol)/Wmax
lost_rate	0	Water evapotranspirated per river unit length [%/km]
temp_sea_level	8	If hydro_model>=2 or K_ice_eros>0: Temperature at sea level
				[C]. 

#EROSION/SEDIMENTATION PARAMETERS (params. used only if erosed_model=1):
erosed_model	0	Defines the erosion/sedimentation model.
			#0: Means no surface transport. The following parameters have no
				effect.
			#1: only hillslope diffusion + landsliding. Non conservative.
			#2: As #1 + rivers following undercapacity model (Beaumont et al.,
				1992): qeq=K_river_cap想惹 and dq/dl=1/erodability*(q-qeq)
				(reaction equation).
			#3: As #1 + rivers following Tucker&Slingerland(1996) model.
				Incision rate under equilibrium capacity (q<qeq):
				dh/dt=erodibility想^(1/3)惹^(2/3) with qeq=K_river_cap想惹 
			#4: As #2 but m/n=1.5 in the eq. transport capacity: qeq=K想^m惹^n
			#5: As #1 + rivers following undercapacity model (van der Beek &
				Bishop, 2003; also described in Cowie et al., 2006),
				implementing channel width in Beaumont's. qeq=K/W想^m惹^n
			#6: As #1 + rivers following hybrid detachment+transport limited
				model, based on the basal shear stress law (formulation and
				values in Garcia-Castellanos & Jimenez-Munt, PlosONE, 2015), accounting
				for channel width: dh/dt=K'想^m惹^n if q<qeq,
				qeq=K_river_cap想惹 where K' is a function of K in dh/dz =
				K*tau^1.5 and K is given through 'erodibility'. Erosion
				gradually decreases to 0 when approaching the eq. capacity
				defined in #2.
			#7: As #1 + river incision following unit stream power e=k_b*w^1;
				w=rho*g*Q*S/W, with w in [W/m^2], e in mm/yr (Ferrier et al.,
				2013, Nature).
				
Keroseol	0	Continental background erosion rate (ratio per My, [m/(m愚y)]).
Ksedim  	0	Additional sedimentation rate below sea level [m/My].
Kerosdif   	0	Diffusive transport coefficient [m2/yr] (e.g., Ks in 
				Kooi&Beaumont,1994,p12193). Tucker&Bras(1998, WaterRes.);
				Tucker&Slingerland(1997,WaterRes) use 10e-2.
				Kooi&Beaumont(1994): 0.5-5.0. Flemings&Jordan (1989) list
				observations of 10e-4 - 10e-2 m2/yr. Braun&Sambridge(1997,
				BasinRes.) use .3 m2/yr Hartley et al., (2013) use 2e-4 - 7e-4
				m2/yr. If diffusion is used to represent also fluvial
				transport, then Flemings&Jordan (1989) document up to 10e5 in
				delta progradations). Avouac&Burov(1996) compile 1e3-1e4 m2/s
				for such large-scale modelling.
critical_slope	0	Maximum surface slope (slope triggering landsliding, 
				[m/m]), (0 means no landsliding). 
K_river_cap	500	For erosed_model>=2: Constant for river transport capacity
				[kg/m3]: qeq = K_river_cap*Qw*Slope Units are kg sedim. per m3
				water for S=1, different than in literature, e.g. T&S96 use .1
				m3/m3, divide tAo values by denssedim to compare). For
				erosed_model>=3 it has influence only under ~1000. Use a higher
				value if you need a detachment-limited incision model.
erodibility	1e-07	This default erodibility value is ignored for units with a
				value specified in their *.UNIT file.
			If erosed_model=2,4,5: length scale of fluvial erosion [m] (~1e5
				m); 
			If erosed_model=3: erodibility in 
				meters_rock/(s*(m3_water/s)^(1/3)) ; ~1e-7,1e-4 m_rock^(1/3)/yr
				(Stock&Montgomery,1999; Sobel et al,2003). Divide by
				rain[m/yr]^1/3 and by 1e5=(365*24*3600)^(2/3) to convert the
				units of these authors to TISC's units.
			If erosed_model=6: erodibility in the shear stress formula:
				erosion=K_b*tau^a. 1e-7 to 1e-5 for a=1.5 for contin. scales.
				Units: meters_rock/yr / (kg/m3 * m/s2 * m)^a == meters_rock/yr /
				(Pa)^a
			If erosed_model=7: k_b=2.3e-7 (m/yr)/(W/m2) (for volcanics, 90-day
				recurrence Qw; Ferrier et al., 2013, Nature).
erodibility_sed	1e-06	Same as 'erodibility' but for sediments.
l_fluv_sedim	2.5e+04	Sedimentation decay distance [m] (fluvial aggradation 
				or delta sedimentation). For erosed_model=3, this is only
				relevant for delta sedimentation at the sea and lakes. Larger
				values imply wider deltas and a more gradual transition from
				river incision to river aggradation.
deform_sed	1	0 means that sediment units will remain steady (velocity =0); 1
				means that sediment will be automatically deformed by the
				motion of Blocks. 
eros_bound_cond	0000	Boundary Conditions for surface processes at the N, S,
				E, W boundaries of the model (4 characters):
			#0: means river has 0 equilibrium capacity (q_eq in 
				Garcia-Castellanos,2002) at boundary.
			#1: means that the river keeps constant slope across the boundary.
			#2: means zero river erosion or sedimentation.
			#3: means half capacity.
			#c: as 1 but under sea-level areas will not be connected to ocean
				at that boundary. 
K_ice_eros	0	Constant of ice incision rate relating ice sliding velocity to
				erosion [(m/yr)/(m/yr)]. 0 means no ice computation.
				Observations by Boulton, 1974, (cited in Glacial Geologic
				Processes, David Drewry, 1987), imply [.05e-3-.2e-3]. Tomkin's
				thesis and Braun et al., 2001, J. Climatology, use [2.5e-3 -
				.1e-3].

Comments:
	The original copy of this file contains the TISC default parameters and is
	located at ./tisc/doc/. Copy it to your project directory as 
	'projectname.PRM' and then edit to use as the parameters file for your new
	project. Note that:
	--The first column is interpreted as potential parameter names; the second
	contains the associated values.
	--You can modify the format of this parameter file, either by adding more
	comment lines or changing comments in the existing lines after the values.
	Order in the list of parameters is irrelevant except for the version, which
	must be first.
	--You can modify most of these parameters from the command line (see option
	-q). Command line options are intepreted after reading this PRM file, so
	they overwrite these values.
	--You only need to include the parameters which default value you want to
	change relative to the default ones in doc/template.PRM.
	--Default units: I.S. (except where indicated).
